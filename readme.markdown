# C

Auto-generated types to make binding C code easier while preserving the semantics of the original code.


# Usage

Identifiers are almost 1:1 with C, only replacing spaces with underscores.

```c++
// Jai:
c :: #import "C";

SomeLib :: #foreign_library "somelib";
does_something :: (x: *c.char) -> c.unsigned_long_long     #foreign SomeLib;
another_thing  :: (y: c.short) -> c.unsigned_long_long_int #foreign SomeLib;

// C:
unsigned long long does_something(char* x);
unsigned long long int another_thing(short y);
```


# Building

Module dependent files can be generated by calling `jai generator/generate.jai`.
Note, the generator script requires `generator/sizes.c` to be compiled into a 
dynamic/shared library. This can be done by running the `build.bat/build.sh`
scripts within `generator/`.
